# AI Data Pipeline Troubleshooter

## Problem Statement
Data pipelines built on Hadoop, Spark, and Airflow frequently fail due to
resource constraints and configuration issues. Diagnosing these failures
requires manual log inspection, which is time-consuming and repetitive.

## Project Goal
Build an AI-powered system that analyzes failure logs and suggests probable
root causes and fixes.

## Initial Scope (V1)
- Analyze Spark and Airflow logs
- Identify error type
- Suggest root cause and resolution
